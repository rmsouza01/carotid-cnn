# carotid-cnn
This repository contain  the source code corresponding to a Convolutional Neural Network with time context
for segmenting the carotid artery lumen on Dynamic MR images. The code corresponds to the 12-fold cross-
validation submiyted to the 2018 ISMRM. It should be fairly straightforward to adapt it toyour problem.


The training patches can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GtwQbjROhTsJEv1IZpR3XqRgaF6Xycaw. 
Unfortunately I cannot provide the entire volumes to be used in the test stage.
